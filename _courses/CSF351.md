TOC deals with computers as a topic of abstraction. Using the tools from Discrete Mathematics, we construct rigorous [`proofs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof) for computational systems and analyze what problems can be solved by a computer. This subject is also referred to as `Automata Theory` and includes theoretical models such as [`Finite State Machines`](https://brilliant.org/wiki/finite-state-machines/), [`Turing Machines`](https://brilliant.org/wiki/turing-machines/) and more. The ideas presented here are perhaps some of the most abstract, yet elegant pieces of information you will come across in your journey in CS.
