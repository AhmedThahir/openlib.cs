DD lets you take your first steps into the `Computer Organization & Architecture` track. In this course, you'll learn how hardware at the bare-minimum level is created and combined together as circuits to scale up as complex processing machines we call computers. It's a course that spans mutlipe topics and has some interesting problems in terms of `circuit design and analysis`. The lab gives you  a full-hands on in implementing the design ideas from the lecture class.
