## Usage

*   A directory is maintained for each course within which is a README that provides information regarding the course. The README may have the following sections if applicable :
    *   **Prerequisites** - Courses that need to be completed prior to attempting the particular course
    *   **Textbooks** - List of textbooks with links to their soft copies
    *   **Lab Programs** - Implementation of the programs taught during the practical hours
    *   **Videos** - List of links of video explanations of course concepts
    *   **Websites** - Useful websites
    *   **Articles** - Cheat-sheets, tutorials, blog-posts etc.
    *   **Communities** - Online forums related to the course concepts
    *   **Apps** - Mobile apps that may enrich the learning experience
*   There are also [scripts](./scripts) that provide certain useful features (WIP)

## Guidelines

*   This repository provides links to the required study material such as **textbooks**, **solution manuals** and **reference books**.
*   Copies of the study material can be borrowed from the library while appearing for **open-book exams**. Moreover, printouts of the same can also be taken into the exam hall if required. Written notes are also allowed.
