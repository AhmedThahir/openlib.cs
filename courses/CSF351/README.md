# Theory of Computation

## Overview
TOC deals with computers as a topic of abstraction. Using the tools from Discrete Mathematics, we construct rigorous proofs for computational systems and analyze what problems can be solved by a computer. This subject is also referred to as Automata Theory and includes theoretical models such as Finite State Machines, Turing Machines and more. The ideas presented here are perhaps some of the most abstract, yet elegant pieces of information you will come across in your journey in CS.
