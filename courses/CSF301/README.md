# Principles of Programming Languages

## Overview
POPL is meant as a precursor for Compiler Construction. This course takes you through the design of programming languages and programming grammars. It also covers programming paradigms like functional programming (LISP), logic programming (prolog) and C++. You will also learn the various data structures and ideas involved in the backend of these languages such as activation records, tail recursion, etc.
