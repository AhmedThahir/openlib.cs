# Design & Analysis of Algorithms

## Overview
DAA reconciles Data Structures & Algorithms with the Theory of Computation. In this course, you will learn to systematically create and  analyze algorithms of your own making and set boundaries on its running time using the notion of Complexity Classes. The course also covers various algorithm design & problem solving strategies such as Divide & Conquer, Dynamic Programming & Approximation Algorithms. 

## Prerequisites
This course has the following prerequisites.
* [Data Structures of Algorithms](../CSF211)
* [Theory of Computation](../CSF351)
