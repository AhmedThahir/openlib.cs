# Machine Learning

## Overview
The course introduces the key algorithms and theory that forms the core of machine learning. It covers Major Approaches such as [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning), [semi-supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning), and [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning). Topics covered include regression, decision trees, suport vector machines, artificial neural networks, Bayesian techniques, Hidden Markov, etc.
