# Logic in Computer Science

## Overview

LCS is a relatively easy course where you'll learn about `propositional`, `predicate` and `temporal` logic along with `Program Correctness` & `Model Checking`. It's an abstract subject that finds some applications in rule-based AI.  It forms the bases for reasoning about computational systems and arguments/proofs related to computer programs.
