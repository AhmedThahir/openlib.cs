# Logic in Computer Science

## Overview

LCS is a relatively easy course where you'll learn about propositional, predicate and temporal logic along with Program correctness. It's an abstract subject that finds some applications in rule-based AI and Model checking.  It forms the bases for reasoning about computational systems and arguments/proofs related to computer programs.
